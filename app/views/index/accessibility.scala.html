        <p>The Fast Stream digital team is committed to making sure our <a href="@routes.SignInController.present()">website</a>
            is accessible to all potential applicants.</p>
        <p>We particularly want to make sure our online service complies with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG version 2.1)
            in line with The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
        <p>In order to help us achieve and maintain this objective, we have commissioned
            <a href="http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org">The Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> to carry out a technical
            compliance audit that will include extensive testing by users with a wide range of disabilities.</p>
        <p>This audit is scheduled to take place in the week commencing 5th October 2020.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, if you are experiencing any barriers to accessing the service please contact us at the following
